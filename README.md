# GIPHY_API

## HOW TO:

### Clicking one of the movie buttons will add GIFs to the page from GIPHY API and also call OMDB API at top of page for that clicked movie.

### If you click the same button again it will load 10 more GIFs. This will continue as long as you press that same button. 

### You can add a movie by filling in the "Add a movie" input and clicking submit. This new movie will act just like the other buttons. It will bring up 10 gifs and when clicked again it will bring up 10 new gifs added to the page.

### Clicking on any of the GIFs will set them to animated or still phase. Alternating depending on what state it is upon click.
